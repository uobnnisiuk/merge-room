# merge-room

A workspace where code changes are discussed,
reviewed, and *decided* before becoming a pull request.

This project explores a workflow where:
- fast iteration happens privately (with AI),
- discussion happens synchronously,
- and pull requests are used as a finalization step, not a discussion space.
